## Overview

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

‚ö° This challenge was to build a Social Media Dashboard landing page, with a toggle that switches the colour theme from Dark and Light mode, using HTML, CSS and JS.

üöÄ I built this while following alongside [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)'s course by [@TheCoderCoder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNf0liwUzMN6_pixbQlMhQ). Check it out [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfUjg0S2uI)!
